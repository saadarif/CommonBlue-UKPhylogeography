## Various BASH/R scripts for analysis from:



Scripts in the main folder are for calling genotypes in both the Common Blue
and the Wolbachia that infecet them

The folder **Data** has some downstream vcf files used for most of the analysis in the above citation. It also contains barcodes for demultiplexing the 
associated illumina data archived in the NCBI SRA (SRR11238035 & SRR11238036).

Some of the script content had been co-opted from other sources. The Stacks genotyping is largely based on scripts from Rochette and Catchen (Nat. Prot., 2017)
